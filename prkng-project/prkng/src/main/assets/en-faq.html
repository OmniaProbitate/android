No more parking fines, no more headaches: we tell you when and where you can park free of charge, directs you to lots with available space, and lets you pay straight from your phone. What could be better?</p></div></div><div> <h3>Why no vowels in your name?</h3> <div> <p>Actually, we have nothing against vowels: we just really, REALLY love consonants. </p></div></div><div> <h3>In which cities does prkng operate?</h3> <div> <p>You can use the app in Montreal and Quebec City (Canada) in the following districts : <br>Montreal: <i>Rosemont - La Petite-Patrie, Plateau-Mont-Royal, Ville-Marie, Sud-Ouest</i> <br>Québec: <i>Charlesbourg, Cité-Limoilou, Sillery, Sainte-Foy</i> <br></p></div></div><div> <h3>When will you operate in XYZ city or district?</h3> <div> <p>The following districts will be added in the next update :<br>Montreal: <i>St-Laurent, Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, Outremont, Côte-des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-de-Grâce</i><br>As for new cities, we are working hard to add several other American and Canadian metropolises by the end of 2015. </p></div></div><div> <h3>Where does your data come from?</h3> <div> <p>The app is based on cities’ open datasets. You can review the license agreements and download the data from <a href="http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/stationnement-sur-rue-signalisation-courant" target="blank">Montreal here</a>, and from <a href="http://donnees.ville.quebec.qc.ca/donne_details.aspx?jdid=7" target="blank">Quebec City here</a>. </p></div></div><div> <h3>So, if the city is providing the data, it should be 100% accurate?</h3> <div> <p>Well, this is not quite true, and that’s why it’s important to stay vigilent: you should always rely more on the street parking signs. That said, we have corrected most of the errors from the database, and we are in contact with partners cities to ensure appropriate updates. If you are aware of any mismatch, you can report it through the app by taking a picture of the sign post: you just have to press the exclamation mark in the “my car” tab. Thank you for the help! </p></div></div><div> <h3>What happens if I get a parking ticket because of you?</h3> <div> <p>Oh, that’s not cool, sorry! Unfortunately, as noted in <i>point A</i> from our Terms of use, we do not offer any guarantee as to the validity of the information provided, and we are not liable for any parking tickets or conflict with the local authorities. However, if you can prove (ie. check-in record) that you got fined by our fault, we won’t let you down. Take a picture of the actual parking sign and report it through the app: we will mail you an amazing postcard with a mosaic of koalas and a message to cheer you up! </p></div></div><div> <h3>When are you going to include paid parking?</h3> <div> <p>This September, you’ll be able to consult the schedule and price of metered spots where applicable, in Montreal and Quebec City. Moreover, starting October, it will be possible to book and pay a spot in more than 50 partners garages, in Montreal and Quebec City. </p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
